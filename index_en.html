    <div class="about-me">
        <p class="title">About Me!</p>
        <p>My name is Jorge Pinto. I am 29 years old and I am in the last year of IT Enginering Course in Lamego School of Technology and Management.</p>
        <p>I began my professional career in energy and telecomunications area. During this path I did a Technical Course in Electricity and Automation (level 5) to acquire more skills and knowledge to get more opportunities and challenges in the world of work.</p>
        <p>
            However, those did not fulfill me professionally. In fact, I feel that just being a superior technician It is not the only required condition for companies because It is essential to have access to a continuous formation to face new challanges.
            When I became financially stable and still working, I decided to try a new area that is evoluting and requires continuous training. As I am a keen on technology, I began my degree. I confess this course exceeded my expectations because this is helping me developing my skills in such a way that I would never think It could be possible, I try to learn more and more to consolidate my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my opinion, school/education does not prepare us for the labour market, but gives us the tools and knowledge to work with. Everyday I invest in my knowledge that is why I am attending foreign languages classes like English (I pretend to get C2 certificate). Last year, I started learning German because I realised the importance to comunicate in diferent languages as we are in a global world. I always try to be updated about new technology. For this reason I enjoy making expiriences at home with servers, VPN and NAS. I am aware of several webpages about tech development such as Codecademy where I have access to a lot of information about programming languages and IT in general, I make a lot of courses there.</p>
        <p>
            Along my professional path, I was a team leader and responsible for some tasks. I like to work as a team, I am an organized and hard-working person, I try my best to achive my goals. I am also very creative because I am constantly thinking about new ideas and new projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite hobby is making some electronic gadgets with microcontrolers such as ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry pie or pure eletronic. I like a lot the concept DIY (Doing your self) because I learn a lot with new peojects and there problems too.
